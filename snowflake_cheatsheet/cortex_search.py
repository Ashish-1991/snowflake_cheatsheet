            - Use the SEARCH_PREVIEW SQL function only for quick testing and validation‚Äîit‚Äôs slower and has a strict 300 KB response limit.
            - Choose your query method based on the use case: use the Python API for pipelines, REST API for external apps, and SQL for simple previews.
            - Improve search result ranking by applying `numeric_boosts` (with columns and weights) and `time_decays` (for recency signals) during queries.
            - To reduce embedding costs, avoid frequent row updates, as any change‚Äîeven outside the search column‚Äîtriggers re-embedding.
            - Set the `TARGET_LAG` parameter based on your business needs to avoid unnecessary refreshes and compute costs.
            - Disable reranking during queries to reduce latency by 100‚Äì300ms if precise result quality is not essential.
            - Suspend the service when it‚Äôs not actively serving queries to avoid ongoing serving compute charges.
            - Keep the source query simple and avoid joins or complex transformations to reduce indexing time and cost.
            - Monitor compute and serving costs using the `CORTEX_SEARCH_DAILY_USAGE_HISTORY` and `CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVING_USAGE_HISTORY` views.
